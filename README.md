# UCSB MasterScholar Submission
This is the repository for Xiwen Jiang and other members of Team Fake to submit the code files during the UCSB MasterScholar summer program.

# Some Notes For The Files
An edited dataset is used for the program. It is attached as "WELFake_Dataset.csv" in the repository.<br>
For running the LLM based model, which uses Mistral 7B, an access token should be generated at HuggingFace and Write permission should be granted. Enter it when required.<br>
Also, the purchase of Google Colab Pro or Pro+ is strongly recommended if you wish to run the notebook on Colab, and the usage of an A100 is recommended and was used during the training.<br>
