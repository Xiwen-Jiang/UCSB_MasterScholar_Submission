# UCSB MasterScholar Submission
This is the repository for Xiwen Jiang and other members of Team Fake to submit the code files during the UCSB MasterScholar summer program.

# Some Notes For The Files
An edited dataset is used for the program.<br>
You can access it via huggingface.co/datasets/Summitsky/WELFake_Dataset_Edited  <br>
For running the LLM based model, which uses Mistral 7B, an access token should be generated at HuggingFace and Write permission should be granted. Enter it when required.<br>
Also, the purchase of Google Colab Pro or Pro+ is strongly recommended if you wish to run the notebook on Colab, and the usage of an A100 is recommended and was used during the training.<br>
